znet - a simple C network library
---------------------------------

This library is inspired by Yawei Zhang's ZsummerX[1] library, but this one is
a pure C version. Now it implement a IOCP (IO Completion Port) backend on
Windows, and a epoll backend on Linux. A select-based backend is planed.

It also have a buffer implement, mainly based the luaL_Buffer in Lua code. But
the interface is targeted by send/recv method, so it's very useful to make
znet send data continually and receive packets by packets.

See test.c for examples, and you can see more things in examples folder.

Have fun :)


TODO
----
- Lua binding is working-in-progress.
- select backend are planed.
- multi-thread support.
